# Mood-Tracker
A Mental Health App to help keep track of Moods

#Known Issues:
	App does not Save State between uses
	The History Log needs to Format in a Pretty Way when viewed by User 
	Is there a way to not use Globals?
	The Quote of the day Function is not yet pulling random quotes from a text file (does it make more sense to do this via a JSON Dump or a Dict/List in main.py

#Possible Features To Introduce:
	User Profiles?
	More specific Behavior Tracking
	Anxiety Management Tips that are extensible by the user?  (Allows the user can add in their own "This is something I've found useful/that should be used in this situation")
	List of External Mental Health Resources that pulls from a text file, or from the web.  (It could Try grabbing the text file from the web first, and then if that doesn't work, pull the local text file)
